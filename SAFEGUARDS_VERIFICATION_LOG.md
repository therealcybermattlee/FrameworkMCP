## VERIFICATION STATUS

### CONTROL 1: Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets

#### ‚úÖ Safeguard 1.1: Establish and Maintain a Detailed Enterprise Asset Inventory

**PDF Review Date:** 2025-08-21

**üü† Orange Elements (Governance) - FROM PDF:**
- "Establish" 
- "Maintain"
- "Enterprise Asset Management Policy / Process"
- "Review and update the inventory of all enterprise assets bi-annually, or more frequently"

**CURRENT CODE (Governance Elements):**
```
"establish inventory process",
"maintain inventory process", 
"documented process",
"review and update bi-annually",
"enterprise asset management policy"
```

**‚ùå ISSUES FOUND:**
1. "documented process" - NOT found in PDF orange elements
2. Missing "or more frequently" from the bi-annual requirement
3. Elements are paraphrased rather than exact text

**üü¢ Green Elements (Core Requirements) - FROM PDF:**
- "accurate, detailed, and up-to-date inventory of all enterprise assets with the potential to store or process data"
- Individual green boxes: "Detailed", "Accurate", "Potential to store or process data"

**CURRENT CODE (Core Requirements):**
```
"accurate inventory",
"detailed inventory", 
"up-to-date inventory",
"all enterprise assets",
"potential to store or process data"
```

**‚ùå ISSUES FOUND:**
1. Elements are broken down artificially - should be the complete phrase from the safeguard description
2. Missing "up-to-date" as a standalone element from the PDF

**üü° Yellow Elements (Sub-taxonomical) - FROM PDF:**
From yellow hexagons and boxes:
- "Network Address (IF STATIC)"
- "Hardware Address" 
- "Machine Name"
- "Enterprise asset owner"
- "Department for each asset"
- "Asset has been approved to connect to the network"
- "End-User Devices" ‚Üí "Mobile", "Portable"
- "Network Devices"
- "IOT Devices" 
- "Servers"
- "Connected to Infrastructure" ‚Üí "Physically", "Virtually", "Remotely"
- "Those within cloud environments"
- "Regularly Connected Devices - NOT Under Control of Enterprise"

**CURRENT CODE (Sub-taxonomical Elements):**
```
"network address (if static)",
"hardware address",
"machine name", 
"enterprise asset owner",
"department for each asset",
"approved to connect to network",
"end-user devices (portable and mobile)",
"network devices",
"non-computing/IoT devices", 
"servers",
"physical connection",
"virtual connection", 
"remote connection",
"cloud environments",
"regularly connected devices not under enterprise control"
```

**‚ùå ISSUES FOUND:**
1. "non-computing/IoT devices" should be "IOT Devices" (exact from PDF)
2. "approved to connect to network" missing "Asset has been" prefix
3. Connection types are paraphrased ("physical connection" vs "Physically")
4. "cloud environments" should be "Those within cloud environments"

**‚ö´ Gray Elements (Implementation Suggestions) - FROM PDF:**
- "For mobile end-user devices, MDM type tools can support this process, where appropriate"

**CURRENT CODE (Implementation Suggestions):**
```
"MDM type tools for mobile devices",
"enterprise and software asset management tool",
"asset discovery tools",
"DHCP logging",
"passive discovery tools"
```

**‚ùå ISSUES FOUND:**
1. Only includes partial text from the gray element - missing complete context
2. Added multiple items not found in PDF gray sections for this safeguard
3. Should only include the exact gray text from PDF

- Green: "Address Unauthorized Assets"  
- Yellow: "On a weekly basis"
- Gray: "The enterprise may choose to remove the asset from the network, deny the asset from connecting remotely to the network, or quarantine the asset"

#### ‚úÖ Safeguard 1.3: Utilize an Active Discovery Tool
**CORRECTED:** Updated to exact PDF elements only
- Orange: Two exact phrases from PDF text
- Green: "Active discovery tool", "Identify Assets Connected To Network"
- Yellow: "Utilize", "Configure", "Execute daily", "Execute daily, or more frequently"
- Gray: Empty (no gray text identified in PDF)

#### ‚úÖ Safeguard 1.4: Use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Logging to Update Enterprise Asset Inventory
**CORRECTED:** Updated to exact PDF elements only
- Orange: Two complete sentences from PDF
- Green: "DHCP Logging on all DHCP servers", "IPAM", "Update asset inventory"
- Yellow: "Use", "Review and Use Logs", "Update asset inventory", "Weekly", "More Frequently"
- Gray: Empty (no gray text identified in PDF)

#### ‚úÖ Safeguard 1.5: Use a Passive Asset Discovery Tool
**CORRECTED:** Updated to exact PDF elements only
- Orange: Two complete sentences from PDF
- Green: "Passive Discovery Tool", "Identify Assets Connected To Network", "Update asset inventory"
- Yellow: "Use", "Review and Use scans", "Update asset inventory", "Weekly", "More Frequently"
- Gray: Empty (no gray text identified in PDF)
