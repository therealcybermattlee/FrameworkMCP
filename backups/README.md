# Framework MCP Backups

This directory contains backups created during the CIS Safeguards migration process.

## Sprint 1 Day 1 Backups

- **safeguard-manager-5-safeguards.ts** - Original SafeguardManager with only 5 sample safeguards
- **Created**: 2025-08-21 during CIS Safeguards migration Sprint 1

## Restore Instructions

To restore from backup if needed:

```bash
# Restore SafeguardManager to 5-safeguard state
cp backups/safeguard-manager-5-safeguards.ts src/core/safeguard-manager.ts
npm run build
```

## Migration Context

These backups were created during the fix for the critical bug where SafeguardManager only loaded 5 safeguards instead of the complete 153 CIS Controls v8.1 dataset. The migration plan involves:

1. Data extraction and analysis (Sprint 1)
2. SafeguardManager integration (Sprint 2)
3. Interface testing (Sprint 3)
4. Capability testing (Sprint 4)
5. Production release (Sprint 5)
