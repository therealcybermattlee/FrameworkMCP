A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server providing **authoritative CIS Controls Framework data** to empower LLMs with sophisticated, context-aware vendor capability analysis. This Pure Data Provider architecture enables security professionals to perform flexible, intelligent assessment of vendor tool capabilities against specific CIS Control safeguards.

## üéØ Purpose

This MCP server empowers security teams to:
- **Access authoritative CIS Controls data** for all 153 safeguards across 18 controls
- **Leverage LLM intelligence** for sophisticated, context-aware vendor capability analysis
- **Perform flexible assessment** across 5 capability types: Full, Partial, Facilitates, Governance, and Validates
- **Apply custom analysis methodologies** with complete transparency and reasoning

## üéØ The 5 Capability Roles

| Capability Role | Description | LLM Analysis Approach |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------------| 
| **FULL** | Complete implementation of safeguard requirements | LLMs assess comprehensive coverage against detailed safeguard data |
| **PARTIAL** | Limited scope implementation with clear boundaries | LLMs identify scope limitations and coverage gaps |
| **FACILITATES** | Enhancement capabilities that enable others to implement safeguards better/faster/stronger | LLMs recognize facilitation patterns and indirect support capabilities |
| **GOVERNANCE** | Policy/process management and oversight capabilities | LLMs evaluate governance elements and process management features |
| **VALIDATES** | Verification capabilities providing evidence and reporting | LLMs assess audit, monitoring, and reporting capabilities |

## üé® CIS Controls Framework Integration

The server uses the CIS Controls visual framework with color-coded categorization:

- **üü† Orange Elements**: Governance requirements that MUST be met
- **üü¢ Green Elements**: Core "what" of the safeguard  
- **üü° Yellow Elements**: Sub-taxonomical components
- **‚ö´ Gray Elements**: Implementation suggestions and methods

## üöÄ Installation & Deployment

6. Save and test the connector

#### Step 3: Configure Connection
1. Create a new connection using your custom connector
2. No authentication required (public API)
3. Test with the `/health` endpoint to verify connectivity

#### Step 4: Create Copilot Actions
In your Copilot, create actions for capability assessment:

**Primary Action - Validate Vendor Capability:**
```
Action: Validate Vendor Mapping
Description: Validate vendor capability claims against CIS Controls through content analysis
Connector: Framework MCP Custom Connector
Operation: validateVendorMapping
Parameters:
- vendor_name: {User provided vendor name}

- supporting_text: {Vendor response text}
```

**Secondary Action - Analyze Response:**
```
Action: Analyze Vendor Response
Description: Determine appropriate capability role for vendor response
Connector: Framework MCP Custom Connector
Operation: analyzeVendorResponse
Parameters:
- vendor_name: {User provided vendor name}
- safeguard_id: {CIS safeguard ID}
- response_text: {Vendor response to analyze}
```

#### Step 5: Example Copilot Prompts
Once configured, users can interact with your Copilot:

```
"Validate this vendor capability: CrowdStrike Falcon claims FULL coverage for safeguard 1.1 with this response: 'Our platform provides comprehensive enterprise asset inventory with real-time discovery, automated classification, and continuous monitoring of all hardware and software assets.'"

"Analyze this vendor response for safeguard 5.1: Microsoft Entra ID - 'We provide centralized identity management with automated user provisioning, role-based access controls, and integration with all major business applications.'"

"What are the requirements for CIS safeguard 6.3?"
```

### Verify Installation
```bash
# For MCP usage
claude-code "List available CIS Control safeguards"

# For HTTP API usage  
curl https://your-api-url.com/health

# For Copilot testing
curl -X POST https://your-api-url.com/api/validate-vendor-mapping \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"vendor_name":"Test Vendor","safeguard_id":"1.1","claimed_capability":"facilitates","supporting_text":"We provide supplemental asset tracking capabilities that enhance existing inventory systems."}'
```

## üìã LLM-Driven Analysis Examples

### Basic Vendor Capability Assessment

```bash
claude-code "Get safeguard details for 5.1, then analyze this vendor response: SecureIAM Corp - 'Our tool is a full identity provider with comprehensive account management. We maintain detailed user inventories including names, usernames, departments, and access rights. Automated quarterly reviews ensure all accounts are authorized and compliant.' Determine appropriate capability role and provide confidence assessment."
```

### Context-Aware Analysis

```bash
claude-code "Get safeguard 8.2 details. For a high-risk financial services environment, analyze this logging solution: 'We collect endpoint telemetry and forward logs to SIEM platforms.' Consider regulatory requirements (SOX, PCI-DSS) and determine capability role with implementation recommendations."
```

### Multi-Vendor Comparative Analysis

```bash
claude-code "Get safeguard 1.1 details. Compare these asset management solutions and rank by implementation completeness for a 500-employee company: 1) Lansweeper: 'Complete network discovery and automated inventory' 2) ServiceNow: 'CMDB with manual asset entry workflows' 3) Microsoft Intune: 'Managed device tracking with Azure AD integration'. Provide deployment complexity assessment."
```

### Bulk Analysis from File

Create `vendors.csv`:
```csv
vendor,safeguard,response
VendorA,5.1,"Complete IAM solution with policy management and quarterly reviews"
VendorB,5.1,"Basic user directory with manual account tracking"
VendorC,6.3,"MFA enforcement for all external applications with SSO integration"
```

```bash
claude-code "Get details for safeguards referenced in vendors.csv. Analyze each vendor response, determine capability roles, and provide implementation roadmap recommendations based on organizational gaps."
```

### Claim Validation Assessment

```bash
claude-code "Get safeguard 12.4 details. This vendor claims FULL capability for network boundary monitoring: 'We monitor all network traffic, identify unauthorized devices, and generate real-time alerts.' Validate this claim against the specific safeguard requirements and provide evidence-based assessment."
```

### Risk-Based Analysis

```bash
claude-code "Get safeguard 11.1 details. For a healthcare organization with HIPAA requirements, assess Veeam Backup's capability: 'Automated daily backups with 99.9% recovery success rate and quarterly recovery testing.' Focus on governance and validation aspects."
```
