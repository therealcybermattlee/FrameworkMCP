A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that determines vendor tool **capability roles** (Full Implementation, Partial Implementation, Facilitates, Governance, Validates) against the **CIS Controls Framework**. This tool helps security professionals accurately categorize vendor capabilities for specific CIS Control safeguards with domain validation and evidence-based assessment.

## üéØ Purpose

This MCP server enables security teams to:
- **Determine vendor tool capability roles** for specific CIS Control safeguards (1.1, 5.1, 6.3, etc.)
- **Validate implementation capability claims** (FULL/PARTIAL) with domain-appropriate tool type verification
- **Accurately categorize vendor roles** across 5 capability types: Full, Partial, Facilitates, Governance, and Validates
- **Generate evidence-based assessments** showing capability alignment and domain validation results

## üéØ The 5 Capability Roles

| Capability Role | Description | Domain Requirements |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **FULL** | Complete implementation of safeguard requirements | Must use domain-appropriate tool types (e.g., inventory tools for asset safeguards) |
| **PARTIAL** | Limited scope implementation with clear boundaries | Must use domain-appropriate tool types with explicit scope limitations |
| **FACILITATES** | Enhancement capabilities that enable others to implement safeguards better/faster/stronger | No tool type restrictions - any tool can facilitate |
| **GOVERNANCE** | Policy/process management and oversight capabilities | No tool type restrictions - governance applies across domains |
| **VALIDATES** | Verification capabilities providing evidence and reporting | No tool type restrictions - validation applies across domains |

## üé® CIS Controls Framework Integration

The server uses the CIS Controls visual framework with color-coded categorization:

- **üü† Orange Elements**: Governance requirements that MUST be met
- **üü¢ Green Elements**: Core "what" of the safeguard  
- **üü° Yellow Elements**: Sub-taxonomical components
- **‚ö´ Gray Elements**: Implementation suggestions and methods

Connector: Framework MCP Custom Connector
Operation: analyzeVendorResponse
Parameters:
- vendor_name: {User provided vendor name}
- safeguard_id: {CIS safeguard ID}
- response_text: {Vendor response to analyze}
```

#### Step 5: Example Copilot Prompts
Once configured, users can interact with your Copilot:

```
"Validate this vendor capability: CrowdStrike Falcon claims FULL coverage for safeguard 1.1 with this response: 'Our platform provides comprehensive enterprise asset inventory with real-time discovery, automated classification, and continuous monitoring of all hardware and software assets.'"

"Analyze this vendor response for safeguard 5.1: Microsoft Entra ID - 'We provide centralized identity management with automated user provisioning, role-based access controls, and integration with all major business applications.'"

"What are the requirements for CIS safeguard 6.3?"
```

### Verify Installation
```bash
# For MCP usage
claude-code "List available CIS Control safeguards"

# For HTTP API usage  
curl https://your-api-url.com/health

# For Copilot testing
curl -X POST https://your-api-url.com/api/validate-vendor-mapping \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"vendor_name":"Test Vendor","safeguard_id":"1.1","claimed_capability":"facilitates","supporting_text":"We provide supplemental asset tracking capabilities that enhance existing inventory systems."}'
```

## üìã Usage Examples

### Analyze Single Vendor Response

```bash
claude-code "Determine the capability role for this vendor response to safeguard 5.1:
Vendor: SecureIAM Corp
Response: 'Our tool is a full identity provider with comprehensive account management. We maintain detailed user inventories including names, usernames, departments, and access rights. Automated quarterly reviews ensure all accounts are authorized and compliant.'"
```

### Validate Implementation Capability Claims

```bash
claude-code "Validate this implementation capability claim:
Vendor: ComplianceBot
Safeguard: 5.1  
Claimed Capability: FULL
Response: 'We provide automated account lifecycle management with real-time inventory tracking and compliance reporting.'"
```

### Analyze Multiple Vendors from File

Create `vendors.csv`:
```csv
vendor,safeguard,response
VendorA,5.1,"Complete IAM solution with policy management and quarterly reviews"
VendorB,5.1,"Basic user directory with manual account tracking"
VendorC,6.3,"MFA enforcement for all external applications with SSO integration"
```

```bash
claude-code "Determine capability roles for the vendor responses in vendors.csv and provide recommendations"
```

### Get Safeguard Details

```bash
claude-code "Show me the detailed breakdown of safeguard 5.1 including all sub-elements"
```

### Validate Vendor Capability Claims

**NEW**: Validate whether a vendor's stated capability mapping is actually supported by their explanatory text.

```bash
claude-code "Validate this vendor capability claim:
Vendor: SecureAssets Corp
Safeguard: 1.1  
Claimed Capability: FULL
Supporting Text: 'Our comprehensive asset management platform performs automated discovery of all enterprise devices, maintains detailed hardware and software inventories, tracks ownership and location data, provides real-time asset status monitoring, and includes documented inventory procedures with bi-annual review capabilities.'"
```

## üÜï Vendor Mapping Validation

The **validate_vendor_mapping** tool provides evidence-based validation of vendor capability claims. This addresses a critical need: vendors often self-assess their capabilities, but practitioners need to verify whether the supporting evidence actually justifies the claimed mapping.

### Validation Criteria

| Capability | Requirements | Validation Thresholds |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **FULL** | Complete implementation within scope | ‚â•70% core requirements + ‚â•40% sub-elements |
| **PARTIAL** | Limited scope with clear boundaries | ‚â•30% core requirements OR some core + ‚â•20% sub-elements |
| **FACILITATES** | Enables/enhances implementation | Facilitation language present, no direct implementation claims |
| **GOVERNANCE** | Policy/process management | ‚â•60% governance elements + policy language |
| **VALIDATES** | Evidence collection & reporting | Audit/monitoring/reporting capabilities present |

### Domain-Specific Validation Rules

**CRITICAL**: The validation tool enforces domain-specific requirements for capability claims:

| Safeguard | Domain | Required Tool Types | Rule |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|------|
| **1.1** | Asset Inventory | inventory, asset_management, cmdb, discovery | Only inventory tools can claim FULL/PARTIAL |
| **1.2** | Unauthorized Assets | inventory, asset_management, cmdb, discovery | Only inventory tools can claim FULL/PARTIAL |
| **5.1** | Account Inventory | identity_management, governance | Only identity/governance tools can claim FULL/PARTIAL |
| **6.3** | External MFA | identity_management | Only identity management tools can claim FULL/PARTIAL |
| **7.1** | Vulnerability Process | vulnerability_management, governance | Only vulnerability/governance tools can claim FULL/PARTIAL |

**Auto-Downgrade Logic**: When a tool type doesn't match the safeguard domain:
- **FULL/PARTIAL** claims ‚Üí Automatically downgraded to **FACILITATES**
- **FACILITATES/GOVERNANCE/VALIDATES** claims ‚Üí Remain unchanged
- Validation status becomes **QUESTIONABLE** with explanation

### Validation Statuses

- **SUPPORTED** (70-100%): Evidence strongly supports the claimed capability
- **QUESTIONABLE** (40-69%): Evidence partially supports but has notable gaps OR domain mismatch occurred
- **UNSUPPORTED** (0-39%): Evidence does not adequately support the claim

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Validate a FULL coverage claim (matching domain)
claude-code "Use validate_vendor_mapping for vendor 'AssetMax Pro', safeguard '1.1', claimed capability 'full', with supporting text: 'Our platform provides comprehensive automated discovery, detailed inventory management, and complete asset lifecycle tracking for all enterprise devices including servers, workstations, and network equipment.'"

# Validate a FACILITATES claim  
claude-code "Use validate_vendor_mapping for vendor 'ThreatIntel Feed', safeguard '1.1', claimed capability 'facilitates', with supporting text: 'Our threat intelligence service provides supplemental risk data that enriches existing asset management systems, enabling organizations to prioritize asset security based on threat exposure.'"

# Domain mismatch example (auto-downgraded)
claude-code "Use validate_vendor_mapping for vendor 'VulnScanner Pro', safeguard '1.1', claimed capability 'full', with supporting text: 'Our vulnerability scanner performs comprehensive network discovery and maintains detailed device databases with complete visibility into enterprise infrastructure.'"
# Result: Downgraded from FULL to FACILITATES (vulnerability_management ‚â† inventory tool)

# Questionable claim (insufficient evidence)
claude-code "Use validate_vendor_mapping for vendor 'BasicTracker', safeguard '1.1', claimed capability 'full', with supporting text: 'We help track computers and provide some visibility into your IT environment.'"
```
